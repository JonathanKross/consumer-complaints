# Analyzing Consumer Complaint Data

## Description

This IPython Notebook uses pandas to read and analyze data from the [CFPB Consumer Complaint
Database](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/). This database is
a collection of all complaints made by American consumers to the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau.

## Requirements

Use Pandas to read in the included file, `complaints_dec_2014.csv`.

Calculate and chart:

* Number of complaints by product
* Number of complaints by company (top 10 companies only)
* Number of complaints by company response
* Mean number of complaints by day of week
* Any other insights you find interesting

Write up a summary of what you found from each chart you made.
